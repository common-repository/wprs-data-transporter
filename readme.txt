== Description ==

This plugin allows you to transfer your inputs Schema markups for reviews and star ratings  for Rich Snippets data from one theme/plugin to another. We all know how difficult it can be to switch  between platforms. This plugin remedies that.

Just choose what platform your moving away from, platform you want to move to. Click "analyze" to see what records and elements are compatible, and click "convert" to make the conversion.

This plugin was created to mainly assist [WPRichSnippets](https://wprichsnippets.com/) plugin users to transfer their site data.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin or theme I use (or want to use) isn't included. Will you include it? =

Probably. If it is a paid theme or plugin, the author will have to provide a copy for us to analyze. If it's free, and demand is high enough, we'll include it.

= How stable is this plugin? I don't want to lose all my data. =

All what we can say is that this plugin is a fork of SEO Data Transporter, which is relatively stable and has been in the repository since August, 2010, and no one has reported any problems. As always, be sure to keep a backup of your site, just to be safe.
